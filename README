WSF (Walk Slow and Fast)

It is a simple app made for as a companion to
the japanese walking method - Interval Walking Training (IWT).

The method is simple.
walk relaxed for 3 minutes, then
walk briskly for 3 minutes.

repeat for 30 minutes. thats all.

liked the idea.
needed an app. so just for that.

if you have suggestions and have the time to
improve it, you can do it.
